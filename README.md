## Profile
I am a Software Developer with a strong passion for Functional Programming (FP), with over 6 years of experience in FP. I have solid understanding of FP principles, honed through both professional experience and spare time studies, and I am particularly drawn to its ability to produce reliable, transparent, and concise code.
Additionally, I have 3 years of experience using AWS and I have been using Linux for 8 years across work, study, and hobbies. I enjoy tackling complex problems both individually and as part of a team, and enjoy learning from others as well as sharing my knowledge with others. I strive to create simple, maintainable, and robust solutions.

## History of Employment
**Software developer** @ Criipto _(dec 2021 - now)_
- At Criipto, a broker for E-ID solutions like Danish MitID and Norwegian BankID, I worked on a range of projects. Amongst others Stripe integration, audit logging, and maintainance of existing systems.
- **_Technologies:_** F#, C#, NodeJS, React, Azure, Bicep.

**Software developer** @ [Skatteministeriet / UFST (udviklings og forenklingsstyrelsen)](https://www.ufst.dk/) _(jan 2017 - nov 2021)_
- At Skatteministeriet/UFST, I was part of a project aimed at improving the future valuation and taxation of Danish properties, a crucial initiative for the Danish society after years of neglect in this area. I collaborated with a skilled team of Clojure developers and was involved in the development and review of the backend code for the application used by case workers. My key contributions included working on the event sourcing implementation, designing and implementing various ETL jobs, and working on API implementations. I also contributed to some of the DevOps tasks and dipped my toes into frontend development with ClojureScript.
- **_Technologies:_** Clojure, ClojureScript, AWS, Terraform, Postgresql, Cassandra, Event Sourcing, Docker, Bash, Linux, Jenkins.

**Intern (Software developer)** @ [Noitso](https://www.noitso.dk/) _(feb 2013 - aug 2014)_
- Took part in the development of a CRM solution and provide support to the users of the CRM solution.
- **_Technologies:_** C#, Javascript, HTML5, MSSQL, ASP MVC

**Military Service in the Royal Danish Navy, postman** _(2006 - 2009)_
- Approximately 3 years break from gymnasie. Working as a postman, and volounteered for 4 months of military service in the Royal Danish Navy.

## Education

**Msc in Computer Science and Engineering** @ [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/msc/programmes/computer_science_and_engineering) _(feb 2014- okt 2016)_
- I took courses such as 'Formal Aspects of Software Engineering', 'Stochastic Simulation', 'Fault Tolerant Systems' and 'Social data analysis and visualization'.
- While doing my master thesis, I also worked a little as TA in the course 'Formal Aspects of Software Engineering'.
- I did one semester in Japan at [Tohoku University i Sendai](https://www.eng.tohoku.ac.jp/english/). During this semester I took various Computer Science related courses and worked on a project in a Space Robotics Lab.
- **_Thesis:_** [Model Checking Safety Properties of Distributed Railway Control Systems](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/edoc/imm6955.pdf). I implemented a program in F# to assist with generating models of distributed control systems for railways. The resulting models were then used as input to a model checker.

**BEng Information Technology** @ DTU _(sep 2009 - feb 2014)_
- This bachelor provided me with a great theoretical foundation as well as practical uses of Computer Science. The studies consisted of both individual work and group projects.
- **_Internship:_** at Noitso.
- **_Thesis:_** I implemented an ANN based system for controlling lighting in houses based on movement patterns registered by PIR sensors which was then tested in a simulator.

## Competences
**Programming languages**
- *Clojure.* Worked with it every day at my job at Skatteministeriet/UFST.
- *F#.* One of my preffered languages at University, and used it later again in a professional context at Criipto.
- *Python, Hylang.* Used Python a lot at University for assignments and in my freetime.
- *C#, JavaScript.* Worked with these languages during my internship at Noitso, and again later at Criipto.
- *Elm, Idris, Purescript, Rust.* Been studying and playing with these languages in my spare time over the past few years.
- *C, Java, Scala, Assembly, Prolog, VHDL.* Have light experience with these languages as I learned about or used them at University.

**Other Technologies**
- *MSSQL, Cassandra, Postgres.* Used these database technologies as part of various software implementations at Noitso, UFST and Criipto.
- *Git, Github.* I've been using these tools everyday at UFST and Criipto.
- *AWS.* I have created implementations that use ECS, Fargate, Lambda, Cloudformation, Cloudwatch, SNS, SQS og S3, as part of the work at UFST.
- *Azure.* I have implemented and maintained solutions, using amongst others Bicep, Azure Functions, Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and Webjobs.
- *Docker, Jenkins, Terraform.* I have occasionally worked with these technologies at UFST.
- *Linux, Debian, NixOs.* Been using Linux for many years, both professionally and in my spare time. I prefer to use the terminal as much as possible and I am a fan of the "Unix philosophy".

## Hobbies
- Playing music. Syntheseizers, Samplers and Eurorack (modular syntheseizers).
- DIY Electronics. I've assembled and soldered quite a few Eurorack module DIY kits during the past year. I dream about designing and building my own modules some day.
- Nature. I enjoy long walks or running in the nearby forests, or simply relaxing with a music instrument and headphones outside in nature. I also hope to make more use of my sea kayaking certificate in the near future.
- Learning programming languages and technologies. These days, I especially enjoy learning about Purescript and Rust.
