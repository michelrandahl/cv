## Profile
Software Developer specialized in functional programming for everything from ETL and applications running in the cloud to fullstack software development. I focus on creating simple, maintainable solutions using languages such as PureScript, F# and Clojure.<br>
Recently, I've begun exploring embedded systems development with Rust.

- **_Internship:_** at Noitso
- **_Thesis:_** I implemented an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) based system for controlling lighting in houses based on movement patterns registered by PIR sensors which was then tested in a simulator

## Technical Competences
**Programming languages**<br>
Over the past 15 years, spanning both university studies and professional work, I've worked with and studied a diverse range of programming languages. However I've particularly deepened my expertise in functional programming through dedicated personal projects and self study in my spare time.
- **_Proficient:_** [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/), Python, [F#](https://fsharp.org/), Clojure
- **_Active Focus:_** [Embedded Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded)
- **_Intermediate:_** JavaScript, NodeJS, C#, Java
- **_Limited exposure through coursework, self study, or occasional use:_** Lua, Bash, uLisp, Haskell, TypeScript, Elm, Idris, Elixir, Scala, Prolog, VHDL, C

**Databases**<br>
Extensive experience with SQL databases, and some exposure to NoSQL:
- *MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite:* Proficient in querying, table design, and database integration with application code
- *Cassandra:* Familiarity with NoSQL concepts and distributed databases

**Cloud & DevOps**<br>
While my focus mainly has been on application development and writing code, I have also obtained knowledge and experience with various DevOps topics:
- *GitHub Actions:* Automated testing and deployment
- *AWS:* ECS, Fargate, Lambda, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, S3
- *Azure:* Bicep, Functions, Blob/Table/Queue storage, WebJobs
- *Misc.:* Docker, Jenkins, Makefiles, Terraform, Nix flakes and NixOs

**Security**<br>
Especially my time at Criipto expanded my security awareness:
- Maintain a rigorous weekly system update routine for all devices to ensure optimal security and performance
- Awareness of OWASP Top Ten security risks and their relevance in software development

**Development environment**
- Strong preference for and extensive experience working in a Linux environment, and using terminal-based workflows and tools. I have been using Linux as my daily driver for everything for the past 10 years
- Proficient with Git, which I use almost on a daily basis, for collaborative projects as well as solo and hobby projects

## Speaking and Writing
Proficient in English and Danish

## Beyond Code
- Playing music, especially Synthesizers, Samplers and Eurorack
- DIY Electronics. I have assembled and soldered 20+ different Eurorack DIY kits, and I also like fixing things in my home instead of discarding items the moment something stops working
- Nature. I enjoy being out in nature, whether it be working on my laptop, or walking/running/kayaking
