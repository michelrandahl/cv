## Profile
I am a Software Developer with a strong passion for Functional Programming (FP), leveraging its principles to produce reliable, transparent, and concise code.

I enjoy solving complex problems both independently and collaboratively, valuing knowledge sharing and continuous learning of technologies.

I strive to create solutions that are simple and with as few moving parts as possible, maintainable not only by me, and robust.

With over a decade of experience using Linux for both professional, personal and academic projects, I enjoy terminal-based workflows, command-line tools and scripting away repetitive tasks.
