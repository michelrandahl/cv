## Profile
Software Developer specialized in functional programming for everything from ETL and applications running in the cloud to fullstack software development. I enjoy creating simple, maintainable solutions using languages such as [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/), [F#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/fsharp) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).<br>
Recently, I've begun exploring embedded systems development with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Technical Competences
**- Programming languages**<br>
Over the past 15 years, spanning both university studies and professional work, I've worked with and studied a diverse range of programming languages. However I've particularly deepened my expertise in functional programming through dedicated personal projects and self study in my spare time.

- *Cassandra:* Familiarity with NoSQL concepts and distributed databases

**- Cloud & DevOps**<br>
While my focus mainly has been on application development and writing code, I have also obtained knowledge and experience with various DevOps topics:
- *GitHub Actions:* Automated testing and deployment
- *AWS:* ECS, Fargate, Lambda, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, S3
- *Azure:* Bicep, Functions, Blob/Table/Queue storage, WebJobs
- *Misc.:* Docker, Jenkins, Makefiles, Terraform

**- Security**<br>
Especially my time at Criipto expanded my security awareness:
- Ensuring that all my computers are encrypted and maintaining a rigorous weekly system update routine for all devices to ensure optimal security
- Awareness of [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) security risks and their relevance in software development

**- Development environment**
- Strong preference for and extensive experience working in a Linux environment, and using terminal-based workflows and tools. I have been using Linux as my daily driver for everything for the past 10 years. For the past few years I have been using [NixOs](https://nixos.org/) as my daily driver.
- Proficient with Git, which I use almost on a daily basis, for collaborative projects as well as solo and hobby projects

## Speaking and Writing
Proficient in English and Danish

## Beyond Code
- Playing music, especially Synthesizers, Samplers and Eurorack
- DIY Electronics. I have assembled and soldered 20+ different Eurorack DIY kits, and I also like fixing things in my home instead of discarding items the moment something stops working
- Nature. I enjoy being out in nature, whether it be working on my laptop, or walking/running/kayaking
