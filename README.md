- *Cassandra:* Familiarity with NoSQL concepts and distributed databases

**- Cloud & DevOps**<br>
While my focus mainly has been on application development and writing code, I have also obtained knowledge and experience with various DevOps and Cloud topics:
- *GitHub Actions:* Automated testing and deployment
- *AWS:* ECS, Fargate, Lambda, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, S3
- *Azure:* Bicep, Functions, Blob/Table/Queue storage, WebJobs

- Awareness of [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) security risks and their relevance in software development
- Experience identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities by analyzing CVE reports, implementing recommended fixes through dependency updates, and validating changes through testing

**- Development environment**
- Strong preference for Linux, which I have been using as my daily driver for the past 10 years. Currently running [NixOs](https://nixos.org/), which I enjoy for its declarative nature, easy package/system rollbacks, reliable package management, and reproducible development environments through [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
- Extensive experience with terminal-based tools, favoring such tools for their simplicity, reliability, efficiency, and ease of automation through shell scripting
- Proficient with Git and GitHub, which I have used almost on a daily basis for the past many years, for collaborative projects as well as solo and hobby projects

## Speaking and Writing
Native Danish and proficient in English

## Beyond Code
- Playing music, especially Synthesizers, Samplers and Eurorack
- DIY Electronics. I have assembled and soldered and sometimes programmed 20+ different Eurorack DIY kits and PCBs with self sourced components, furthermore have I designed and built my own rack system to hold and power the modules. I also generally like fixing things in my home instead of discarding items the moment something stops working. Since childhood I have enjoyed disassembling and investigating electronics, although it is only recently that I have started to understand things and gain some intuition about it
- Nature. I enjoy being out in nature, whether it be working on my laptop outdoors, or taking long walks or going for running in the forest or kayaking on the lakes
