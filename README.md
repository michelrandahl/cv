## Profile
I am a Software Developer deeply interested in Functional Programming (FP) and its ability to produce reliable, transparent, and concise code. 
I enjoy solving complex problems both independently and in collaboration, valuing knowledge sharing and learning new things. 
I aim to build simple, robust solutions that are easy for anyone to maintain, not just me. 
I've mainly used Linux as my primary driver over the past decade, and I'm at home in the terminal and enjoy finding ways to make work easier and eliminate repetitive tasks. 

## Work Experience
