## Profile
I am a Software Developer deeply interested in Functional Programming (FP) and its ability to produce reliable, transparent, and concise code. 
I enjoy solving complex problems both independently and in collaboration, valuing knowledge sharing and learning new things. 
I aim to build simple, robust solutions that are easy for anyone to maintain, not just me. 
I've mainly used Linux as my primary driver over the past decade, and I'm at home in the terminal and enjoy finding ways to make work easier and eliminate repetitive tasks. 

## Work Experience
**Independent Study and Project Development** _(Aug 2023 - Present)_<br>
Exploring a potential self-directed career shift, focusing on embedded systems and hardware design to align with personal interests and long-term goals.

Developing skills in embedded systems and hardware design and prototyping, with the goal of developing a commercial [Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack) module:
- Learning Rust, with a focus on Embedded Rust applications
- Open source code contributions for embedded Rust, particularly the STM32 TSC (Touch Sensing Controller) driver in the Embassy library
- Studying embedded systems concepts (SPI, I2C, DAC, ADC, etc.)
- Eurorack module UX prototyping in the form of a web-app made with PureScript [Halogen](https://purescript-halogen.github.io/purescript-halogen/)
- Developing skills in PCB design using KiCAD
- Gaining experience in component selection and sourcing
- Exploring PCB manufacturing processes with providers like [Aisler](https://aisler.net/) and [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/)
- Working towards prototyping a Eurorack module for potential commercialization
- **_Technologies summary:_** Rust (no_std, [RTIC](https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic), [Embassy](https://embassy.dev/)), [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/), [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/), PCB Design, [STM32](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html), Embedded/Electronics datasheet comprehension
